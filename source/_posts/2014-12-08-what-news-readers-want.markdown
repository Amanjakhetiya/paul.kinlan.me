I love the way Developer Realations works.  We work along side the engineering
team to work out how developers (you) could and should create better apps.

One thing that I am working on at the moment is breaking up each of the verticals
that define an app (News, Retail, Games, Travel, Media etc) and working out
what use-cases they need and how web technology can solve them.  One area that

Normally this job entails think of some cool demos when we hear about a new API
and then getting Eng to provide somefeedback followed bu posting about it on
[updates.html5rocks.com](http://updates.htmlrocks.com).

This time I have decided that rather than start with what I think a developer
wants (i.e, shiney demos and API's), I started by asking users what they want
from a "News experience".  This is the first time that I am using
[Google Consumer Surveys](http://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/)
(other good survey tools might exist) and I think it is rather awesome.

I'm still getting used to it, and maybe I could ask stucture my questions more
effectively, but I think I got it working pretty well and I believe the results
are good.

My goal was to find out of the people who prefer to read their news in an App,
what do they prefer about it?

The sample was constrained to US users of an Android Smartphone, the prime
audience of App using News consumers if reports are accurate.

The first question was: How do you prefer to consume the news?  In an app,
on the web or "Other" (the other is a mandatory escape hatch).  If the user
selected "in an app" they were taken to a 2nd set of questions.

Given that a huge majority of News corps are moving away from Apps does
this represent a.  No.  I think this survey really wasn't meant to find that out
I used the web question to filter out people who don't use apps for News.  It is
interesting none the less.
