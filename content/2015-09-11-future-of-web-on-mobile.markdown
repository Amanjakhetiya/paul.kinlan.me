title: "The future of the web on mobile from Coldfront Conf"
description: "The web is changing, we need to adapt"
---
I recently had the fortune of presenting a [Coldfront Conf](https://coldfrontconf.com)
in Copenhagen.  My talk was originally going to be focused on the "Headless web"
and the future of mobile.  I do talk about it briefly, but the idea is roughly that
the web is extending outside of the browser and in many cases the user will
never know they are interacting with a site.  

For the past two years I have been thinking that the way we use the web and experience
the web is under threat (this might be a good thing).

The week prior I  made a trip to India for another confernce and what I saw there
soldified in my thinking that 

{{% slide 1 "Future of the web on mobile" %}}

The future of the web on mobile isn't an assured thing. 
Many new platforms that are easier to publish on and are faster to use 
are appearing with just as many users as the web.

How do we make sure we are relevant in the future:

1. Be Instant 
2. Offer Richer Experiences 
3. Act Installed, Be Ephemeral

All will be explained.

{{% slide 2 "Me. Troll? Never" %}}

This might look like an elaborate troll to get you to follow me, but there
is an important thing about this...

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 3 "Everyone recognises that mobile is important" %}}

Late last year the search team started badging mobile friendly sites when they
were displayed in mobile search.  The team had found that users have a better
experience on the web when the page they were visiting worked well on mobile.

Earier this year (2015) the search team started to downrank sites that were not
"Mobile Friendly".

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 4 "Death of the full screen install banner?" %}}

Now, example is one of the modern burdens for web user's is that there are so many things
that get in the way of complete your task one of them is fullscreen banner's to get you to 
install the app.  

Now if you have a fullscreen banner for your app then search may remove your "Mobile friendly" badge.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 5 "Every thing changes" %}}

This is already happening.  The way you access web content is changing.  Many 
users may never directly open up a browser to experience the web... So what
does it mean for the web?

_Excuse the formatting issue_

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 6 "I went to India and everything for me changed" %}}
I had planned on taking lots of photos, but this was one of the only ones I took.

India and the way people are using phones was incredibly interesting.
{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 7 "Err." %}}
I totally fluffed this joke.  It was supposed to be about my only other pictures 
are reciepts.
{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 8 "Mobile is growing rapidly" %}}
Every year the equivelent of population of the UK is going mobile and for many the web
means nothing because it is a very app centric model.
{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 9 "Screw the web" %}}
There was an interesting divide. There is a huge amount of Venture Capital
pouring in to the market and all of these start-ups are bypassing the web
and going straight to native because it is "what the users want" _and_ 
users are more engaged.... apparently.

Established brands leverage the web, they still have a huge amount of
traffic from desktop too so they have massive presence already but
for many companies it is a now just stopping point to get on to native. 

Acquire a user on the web and push them as quickly as possible in to an app.

Why? Many reasons.
{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 10 "Why 'screw the web'?" %}}

* Lack of Perforamnce
* Can't renegage a user on the web like you can in an app
* Many users are offline or on crappy connections, native apps
  are always there.
* In some cases the browser can't do what they need.

Much of this is _now_ Bullshit.  However...

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 11 "There are percieved and real issues" %}}

Business owners and developers believe that you can't solve these problems 
on the web.

But how did we get here?  I will take you through a little story.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 12 "The difference engine" %}}

Charlse Babbage desiged this in the early 1800's.  The difference engine, 
designed to caluclate polynomials... 

If you ever go to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View I encourage
you to see it in action.

All that being said, it was never built (at least in Babbage's time), but the idea 
was there. Essentially a 3 tonne app. If you want a new piece of functionality
build a new machine.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 13 "The analytical engine" %}}

Babbage knew that programmability was a critical missing piece for the 
difference engine, so he desinged the Analytical Engine.  Again he never
got to build it, but his son Henry tried and this is one of the machines.

It didn't work, apparently it had off by one errors.  But it introduced
Ada Lovelace and the rest of the world to what we now know as computer programming

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 14 "Jump forward 150 years" %}}

We now have centralised general purpose computing machines, with terminals and 
people who will take your punch card to load it on to a machine and give
you the results back next week.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 15 "The Cassette" %}}

This was my first computing experience. The C64. You can take a program, stored
on a cassette and load it on to any C64, you can even save data and transport it
to another machine.

It took you from having massive centralised machines, to finally bringing computing 
in to the home.

_I never had an Apple_

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 16 "I swear this was quick" %}}

At the same time where Diskettes.  I swear these loaded games in 5 seconds.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 17 "Windows 95 Disks == 3 Hour install" %}}

And then 3 1/2 inch floppies that stored over 1 MB of data and were convinient to
take with you.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 18 "CD/DVD" %}}

_Not sure why image is not here_

Finally the CD and DVD. Entire encylopedias and movies on one portable piece of plastic.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 19 "Installing nightmares" %}}

However ever since the 3 1/2 inch floppy, getting the software on to a machine has been 
a nightmare.  Applications break the state of the machine, overwrite central configuration
and generally arse about with your system.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 20 "The Web == Better delivery modal" %}}

Then the web came along and let us distribute application _and use_ with a single click
whilst trading off some of the benefits of an installed application, namely access to
rich functionality and offline storage.

The Web: A vastly superior delivery mechanism.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 21 "Friction was removed" %}}

At every single step a massive source of friction has been removed allowing us to 
do more, more easily.  With the web being the pincale in distribution: Click a link
and use.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 22 "SLICE: The Web" %}}

In Google, one of the (many) ways that we like to try and quickly describe the benefits
of building for the Web.  One is [SLICE](/slice-the-web/). 

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 23 "Secure" %}}

The web is secure. Well, it is secure that sites and apps can't interfere directly
or indirectly with each other.  The Sandboxed model of the web is one of it's
biggest strengths.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 24 "Linkable" %}}

The link enables instant access to the content that is pointed to.  This allows
easy distribution and sharing of content and functionality.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 25 "Indexable" %}}

Because everything is behind a link, if it is publically accessible it can be crawled 
and then indexed so that services can offer a way to find archived information quickly 
and reliably.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 26 "Composable" %}}

We can take code, embeds and widgets and quickly combine them to make brand new experiences
for users.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 27 "Ephemeral" %}}

If you can find a good image that describes "Ephemeral" please let me know.  But the concept
is that when you land on a page and move away, it doesn't leave you machine in a mess and 
none of the logic and code take up resource on your machine.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 28 "A missing U?" %}}

SLUICE would be a terrible acronym, but the ability to udpate an app or site in one location
and have everyone using it immediately is amazingly powerful.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 29 "Does SLICE matter on Mobile?" %}}
Dunno. Maybe. No? Yes?
{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 30 "Mobilithic Era" %}}

A way that I like to look it as there is a pre-internet era that was defined by 
requiring physical mediums for data transport and a current internet era.  There is
also a pre-mobile era (Mobilithic) and the current mobile era.  The top right is
where we are and where all the change is happening.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 31 "The Mobile Era" %}}

Since the iPhone it is estimated that over 2 billion new users have joined the Internet
many of those are on mobile and for many of those mobile is their only way 
of accessing the Internet.

In that era, the Web is still here, but for anything other than games, physical mediums 
have gone.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 32 "Damn you Flurry stats" %}}

We have all seen this.  On mobile everyone just uses Apps and only 14% of time is spent 
inside the browser.  Contrast this with desktop where Microsoft once famoulsy reported 
that the browser was *the most used* app.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 33 "All ships rise on a high tide" %}}

One problem is that as site owners we don't see this happening, we see more and more 
traffic to our sites.  Yes a lot of people spend a lot of time inside apps, but 
many of those apps use the web extenisvely. However we currently have 0 way of tracking usage, 
this traffic from apps is essentially "dark".

Let's take a look because I think it is under threat.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 34 "Many Entry Points" %}}

If you look at mobile, there are so many entry points on to the web.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 35 "Not just the browser" %}}

And they aren't by clicking on the browser icon.  We have huge amounts of traffic coming
from email, messengers and social.  Notifications are a huge driver of engagment
back in to apps and on the web.  And finally, search apps accross all devices and platforms.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 36 "Is the web under threat" %}}

I think so.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 37 "The web developers view of the world" %}}

The Web is ubiquitos.  It is a meta platform that stradles all internet connected computing 
devices.  Build for the web, be everywhere.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 38 "The real view of the world" %}}

Mobile has changed everything.  Messengers are just one class of application that is available
on every platform and has a HUGE number of users.

Facebook: 1 billion active users on the platform in one day.
WeChat: Unknown, but massive.  Apparently most of China.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 40 "They are all content platforms" %}}

The funny thing is that they are all massive content platforms.  Apple with Apple News,
Instant Articles by Facebook and We Chat with Official accounts.

Why write content for the web when you can reach all the users you need to via these other
platforms.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 41 "What are they offering" %}}

One word: Performance.

Look at the pitch for every single platform. It is focused around Performance and the UX benefits
that you get from it.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 42 "Where does the web fit in?" %}}

Well. We can be performant, but as an industry it is the last thing we seem to care about.

Slow clap.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 43 "Step back" %}}

Now step back.  What else do all of these "Meta platforms" offer?

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 44 "It's the Apps, stupid." %}}

Every single platform is vying to be the next platform for apps.  

Think about it for a minute.  

iOs and Android now let you deploy dynamic code inside your app.  If you are platform owner that
allows you to create a framework that makes your app a platform.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 45 "Richer platforms" %}}

And because these platforms are isolated away from standards they can itterate amazingly quickly
and offer more features and capabilities.  Want payments? Cool. We got you.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 46 "Again, where is the web?" %}}

:( 

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 47 "Everyone is a browser" %}}

Every single platform wants to be your next browser. Never leave the app and access all the content
from inside and outside of our platform.

How are people doing this.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 48 "What Web developers want." %}}

We just want you to click a link and go straight into the site (inside the browser). It is 
safe, secure and synchronsied already with the users other browsing history.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 49 "What any practical business wants" %}}

Business want you to never leave the app, stay in brand for as long as possible.  So everyone
makes use of WebViews.  The problems with WebViews is numerous.  One huge downside is that
you (the user) in most cases forefits private browsing history, every platform's WebView
allows the app owner to see where you navigate whilst in app.  Crazy.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 50 "What users want" %}}

Both Apple and Google at the same time recognised that users want the benefits of a web browser
but with none of the drawbacks of a WebView. 

Embeddable Browser's are now a thing with both Chrome Custom Tabs and SFSafariViewController.  You 
get to use your browser, but branded as the App's Browser.  There are a lot more benefits too,
there are no context switches between apps, login state can be shared, no tracking of browsing history
and quick connect are to name but a few.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 51 "Chrome Custom Tabs" %}}

Performance++

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 52 "Each Platform intends to be the next web" %}}

I don't think we are going to get away from this any time soon.  Platforms want to keep you in 
experience so they will use WebViews and Embeddable browsers and they also now want all 
content creation and consumption done "in platform" too.

Both present a very real threat to the web.

{{% /slide %}}

{{% slide 53 "Trojan Horses... React?" %}}

I know it is contentious, but React is a massive trojan horse for Facebook and amazingly clever
too.  

Javascript works everywhere. HTML and CSS really require a browser or WebView to be useful.
So a smart thing to do is abstract HTML Markup and Styling away from the developer for building UI's 
so that you can render native components using JS as the runtime. 

You now have your own platform that run's everywhere, optimized to run natively on the platform 
where the user is.  If you are Facebook, you now have an app platform without app stores.

I will happily place a bet on this :)

Are we all out of a job yet?
