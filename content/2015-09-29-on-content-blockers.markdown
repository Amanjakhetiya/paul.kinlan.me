*Disclosure*: I curently work for a company (Google) that generates some of its 
revenues from Ads.

I am fascinated by content blockers. Not the technology &mdash; that has been
around for yonks &mdash; nor about how it might effect Ads, instead the I am deeply
interested in the fact that iOS is the first *major mobile* platform that supports a blocker built 
into the system browser and the only provider of the system WebView, therefore 
the interesting aspect are the policies enforced by the stores that host them.

Today, the mobile content blocker ecosystem is pretty hairy for developers and 
users because there is enough friction that unless you actively want them and know what they 
do you are unlikely. The friction comes in two forms:

1. It has to be installed 
2. It has to be manually enabled

Two very manual steps. I am pretty confident that over the year and over subsequent iOS 
upgrades we will see the ecosystem adapt and the friction to usage smoothed out or removed.

There are some really interesting things that can be achieved with the Safari Content
Blockers:

I have been trying to think of all the different combinations of things that could 
happen.

The first has already happened. Dedicated apps aimed at managing content blockers take-off 
and see a massive initial spike in usage.  I see them as a similar the original BoxCar that 
provided a centralised app for simulating push notifications on iOS.  What we will see 
is that these tools become parts of apps directly and I think it will follow the following

* "Browsers" are launched that support blocking by default but their lists of 
  blocked content is managed by the app updates.
* A major app is updated and it blocks a competitor's site
* A messaging app blocks a news outlet &mdash; I think this is really far off and will be unlikely to 
  happen, but I could imagine a platform builder that hosts content directly inside their app
  and blocks
