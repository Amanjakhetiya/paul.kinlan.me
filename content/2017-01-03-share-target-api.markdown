I was in Indonesia earlier in 2016 and was idly chatting with developers and it
came up in coversation that the web is screwed. I disagree, but there is an
interesting theory: There are massive platforms (/rise-of-the-meta-platforms/)
out there that are sucking in content created on your devices and making it
accessible only inside those platforms. For example, you capture an image from
your camera and an app which has access to syncrhonises it and allows you to
you share it from the "gallery" and the only options you have is to share it 
only with in that network or at best with other native apps.



You have a link in the browser and you share it, you get a list of apps you can
share it too.

Natives platforms are closed systems that perpetuate the native platform

That chat got me thinking. I am bullish on the web. For people coming to the
computing (specifcically mobile) we are in a great postion. For people already
in computing....
