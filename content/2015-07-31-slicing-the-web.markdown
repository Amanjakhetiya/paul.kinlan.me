There has been a lot of conversation about all the issues of the web.

One of the internal terms that we have used in Google to quickly describe
the positive aspects of the web as a platform for users and developers is
**SLICE**.

It was mentioned at the original Chrome Dev Summit by Linus Upson.  The 
ordering wasn't in the correct order but I do encourage you to watch this
video.

I think it covers a lot of good points:

* **S**ecure - 
* **L**inkable -
* **I**indexable -
* **C**omposable -
* **E**phemeral -

I think it misses out a couple of other
benefits of the web such as the ability to deploy updates instantly.

In a follow up post I will talk about how native platforms are taking a 
cut out of SLICE.
