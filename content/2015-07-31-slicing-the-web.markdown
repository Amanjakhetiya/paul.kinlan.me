There has been a lot of conversation about all the issues of the web at the moment:

* Performance
* Lumpy inconsistent browsers
* Rapidly expanding feature landscape.

I want to put these to the side for a couple of minutes to quickly talk about one of 
terms that we have used in Google to quickly describe the positive aspects of the web 
as a platform for users and developers is **SLICE**.

It was mentioned at the original [Chrome Dev Summit](https://developer.chrome.com/devsummit) 
by Linus Upson in the 2013 keynote.  When Linus talked about the properties of the web
it wasn't in the correct order for naming but I do encourage you to watch this
video.

I think it covers a lot of good points:

* **S**ecure - All domains are sandboxed from each other and sites are sandboxed away
  from the users machine. The user can go to anysite and know they are safe.
* **L**inkable - You can point to any page or piece of content just by sharing a URL
* **I**indexable - Because you can link to anything, if public it can be discovered by any person
  or machine that can index it to make it universally discoverable to everyone.
* **C**omposable - Iframes and JavaScript [todo]
* **E**phemeral - There is nothing to install, you go to the page and interact with it,
  leave the page and when you do it stops taking up resources
  
**SLICE**.

As a term, SLICE is a great way to think about why the web is good today. I think 
it misses out a couple of benefits of the web such as the ability to deploy updates 
instantly. **SLUICE** isn't a great acronym though.

I use the *SLICE* model as a baseline for where we are going with the future of the web.

* **S**ecure -
* **L**inkable - 
* **I**indexable - 
* **C**omposable - 
* **E**phemeral - 

In a follow up post I will talk about how native platforms are taking a 
cut out of SLICE.
