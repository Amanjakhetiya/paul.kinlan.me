I was in Indonesia earlier this year and was idly chatting with people and it
came up in coversation that the web is screwed. There are massive platforms
(/rise-of-the-meta-platforms/) out there that are sucking in content created on
your devices and making it accessible only inside those platforms.  You capture
an image and an app has access to it and syncrhonises it, you share it from the
"gallery" and the only options you have is to share it with other native apps.

You have a link in the browser and you share it, you get a list of apps you can
share it too.

Natives platforms are closed systems that perpetuate the native platform

That chat got me thinking. I am bullish on the web. For people coming to the
computing (specifcically mobile) we are in a great postion. For people already
in computing....
