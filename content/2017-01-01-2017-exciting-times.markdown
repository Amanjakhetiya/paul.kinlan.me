Happy new year!

I thought I would note down some of the things that I am excited about for the
web and that I hope to be writing a bit more about over the coming weeks and
months. This is just a super quick list and isn't based on any sort of priority.

* Web Assembly
  * All browsers shipping within the year. It opens up a lot of interesting 
    possibilities on the web, especially with bringing more native libraries
    to the web ([FFMPEG for example](https://paul.kinlan.me/ffmpeg-ideas/))
* Web Components
  * Majority of browsers shipping all the required requisite components (Shadow
    DOM, Templates, Custom Elements)
* A less [lumpy web](/the-lumpy-web/) with more consistency across browsers to
  help reduce developer pain and frustration.
* Progressive enhancement and Accessibility seem to have been gaining ground a
  little more (although Google Trends suggests otherwise). I am excited to see
  this trend continue and become more important for users and developers.
* A more consistent and prescriptive Media story across platforms
  * How to encode video and audio effectively
  * How to build a next gen media player site
  * How the future of media on the web will work.
* Enhanced Media APIs come to the platform
  * getUserMedia everywhere and WebRTC everywhere
  * Media Session API
  * Web VR - more experiments and exploring where it can go
  * Image Capture API and advanced APIs
* Even more CSS primitives &mdash; CSS Grid is ever so close!
* Headless Chrome lands letting us run more of the [browser on the
  server](https://paul.kinlan.me/running-chrome-on-appengine/) and building
  [interesting services on top of that](https://paul.kinlan.me/chrome-on-home/).
  It will start off with more web hosted developer tools and then in to more
  services once people realise how easy it is.
* [Headless Web](/the-headless-web)
* Increased Service Worker adoption
  * More robust sites that work instantly on first load and work all the times
    even when offline.
  * Better Push Notification integrations
  * Better large download support
* Tighter integration with the host platform when developers and users want it.
  * Generic Sensor API
  * Great apps that use BLE and more adoption of that API
  * Fully installable Web Apps
  * Sharing API 
  * Share receiver API
* [Really hitting home](/slice-the-web/) the benefits of the web to people, businesses and
  developers.
* SSL Everywhere
* A focus on strong UX on the web and Performance and the industry prioritizing
  this.
* The web reaching more people as they come online with Mobile. There is still
  a huge amount of potential and growth in India, Indonesia, China, Thailand,
  Vietnam, all of Africa. You name it, mobile is growing massively still and
  the web is accessible on all of these devices.

I am incredibly excited for 2017 and I am going to keep updating this post. 
What are you excited about with the web?
